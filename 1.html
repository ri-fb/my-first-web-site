Collateral Repair Podcast
The Collateral Repair Podcast aims to share the stories of refugees living in Amman, Jordan.<br><br>
<img src="razer.jpg" width="380">
</p><p style="margin-top:40px;"> On a monthly basis, CRP invites you into an intimate space that will allow you to hear and understand refugees’ experiences in their own words. Each episode features an interview with a member of one of Jordan’s refugee communities, a supporting interview with a professional or employee at CRP, a Q&A in response to listeners’ questions, and a quick update of developments that month at CRP.
If you have comments or questions you would like to hear answered on air, please submit them to podcast [at] collateralrepairproject [dot] org.</p>
